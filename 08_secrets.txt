	08. Secrets
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|--- There exists secrets, ventures yet to be explored and unravalled
|--- Secrets that can be solved using serious effort and are not just impossible.

|--- Reason of Limited Mindset :
	|--- Incrementalism: doing small, required stuff only
	|--- Risk Aversion: scared of being wrong
	|--- Satisfied with what can be achieved
	|--- Doubts: Over the idea and the person

|--- The proof that people still suffer, face problems and there are injustice present makes it viable that the world is not perfect and we can do something about it

|--- You cant find secrets without looking for them
|--- Belief in secrets is an effective truth
|--- We cant solve problems and find solutions until we demand to solve them, and persevere to do so

|--- What secrets are the people not telling you?
|--- Secrets are best looked for places not thought of, dicovered before.
|--- Dont share your secrets when it is not required
